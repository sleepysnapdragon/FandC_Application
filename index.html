            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>
              On 17th December 1989 the very first episode of The Simpsons was
              broadcast. A lesser-known fact is that over on the other side of
              the Atlantic, I was born. Growing up, Bart, Lisa and Maggie had
              Santa's Little Helper; I had Penguin the guinea pig.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2009 I migrated north of the border to study English
              Literature, Language and Latin at the University of Edinburgh. On
              graduating, in the absence of better ideas, I went to work in the
              London insurance market, where I worked in risk and financial
              modelling (if a hurricane hits Miami, how much money do we lose?).
            </p>
            <p>
              4 years later I faced up to the fact that insurance wasn't really
              my thing, and turned down an offer of a sabbatical to quit
              outright and seek pastures new. I had always wanted to live in a
              non-English speaking country and learn a new language, and in
              light of the Brexit referendum result, 2017 seemed like a good
              time to do that.
            </p>
            <p>
              Off I went to Italy, Rome to be precise, with some suncream and a
              minor Duolingo-induced thumb sprain. Here I've spent two years
              teaching English and learning Italian. I've enjoyed this, but it's
              never been the long-term plan. On and off, between pizzas and ice
              creams, I've also been teaching myself to code.
            </p>
            <p>
              This year I've been a volunteer with Italy's first cohort of
              <a href="https://codeyourfuture.io">Code Your Future</a> students,
              who are refugees or disadvantaged Italians. As part of the
              Education Team, I'm responsible for curriculum delivery, e.g.
              co-ordinating mentors, promoting a collaborative learning
              environment, and monitoring student progress.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've had fun and learnt a lot from the course prerequisites and
              building this page. Whether or not I make it to the F&C Winter '19
              cut, I'm excited to keep learning and to find a way to turn these
              skills from a hobby to a livelihood.

          <div id="why-text-top">
            <p>
              I'm applying to Founders and Coders because I want to
              <strong>learn</strong>, because the
              <strong>collaborative</strong> style appeals to me, and because of
              its policy of <strong>inclusivity</strong>. I have largely been
              studying by myself, as there is not much of a learner meet-ups
              community in Rome. I would like to learn how to work on projects
              in teams, as I think this is fundamental for professional coding,
              and I think that people produce better results when they work
              together. This was something I really enjoyed about Codewars:
              seeing the solutions of other users when you solve a challenge was
              a great way of learning from the different knowledge and style of
              others. On inclusivity: a few years ago I was struck by an
              observation that, although it affects us all, the digital future
              is being designed and built by a small, unrepresentative group.
              Unless the tech sector strives to be as inclusive as possible, it
              is inadvertantly disenfranchising many people. I hope that in
              improving my own technical skills, I will be able to help others
              too.
