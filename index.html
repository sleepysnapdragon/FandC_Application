            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>
              On 17th December 1989 the very first episode of The Simpsons was
              broadcast. And a lesser-known fact is that over on the other side
              of the Atlantic, I was born. A fairly uneventful English childhood
              ensued, with companions Teddy the teddy bear and Penguin the
              guinea pig.
            </p>
            <p>
              I then migrated north of the border to study English Literature,
              Language and Latin at the University of Edinburgh. After
              university, in the absence of better ideas, I went to work in the
              London insurance market, where I learned about risk and financial
              modelling.
            </p>
            <p>
              4 years later I faced up to the fact that the insurance industry
              wasn't really my thing, and turned down offers of an extensive
              sabbatical to quit outright and seek new pastures.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had always wanted to live in a non-English speaking country and
              learn a new language, and in light of the Brexit referendum
              result, 2017 seemed like a good time to do that.
            </p>
            <p>
              Off I went to Italy, Rome to be precise, with some suncream and a
              minor Duolingo-induced thumb sprain. Here I've spent two years
              teaching English (some English curiosity)

            <p>
              I've been interested in coding for a long time but it's only
              recently that I've really believed that this could be my career. A
              long, long, time ago... around Y2K... I taught myself HTML with an
              online tutorial. I enjoyed that and I made a couple of little
              websites for myself but I never knew where to go afterwards. When
              I started work I did a range of tasks: administrative, analytical,
              communications... But I always found that I enjoyed the logical
              problem-solving the most. I became an expert at stretching
              Microsoft Excel to within an inch of its life. After leaving that
              job, and while I've been teaching English, I've also been slowly
              learning to code. Founders and Coders appeals to me because of its
              peer-led structure, which I think encourages whilst encouraging
              individuals' hard-work and ownership of their learning: you're not
              paying someone to tell you the answer.
